Hi. My name is Trevor Carson and I am an undergraduate studying CS at Harvey Mudd College, and Mathematical Economics at Pitzer College. 
I am currently a sophomore and I also play D3 football for the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens. I am super interested in AI and machine learning.
Currently I am enrolled in CS060, a data structures and algorithms class at Harvey Mudd. I'd love to meet anyone who can help guide me towards applying 
my interest in CS in any sort of job, or internship, or project that they'd like help on!
